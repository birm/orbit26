# Interaction Test

(test 3 for orbit 26 - birm)

Get the timing right to score points (8th notes).

# Results/Notes
* It took some time to balance points within reason.
* Points are rendered in binary, but the atari TIA mirrors the middle, so it's hard to read. I'll actually have to render something for score.
* Instead of a bunch of pointers in memory, I just put the whole song in a blob. Seems more assembly-like. Also was easier.
