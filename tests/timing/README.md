# Timing Test

(test 2 for orbit 26 - birm)

X axis mapped to frequency/tone; Y axis mapped to control/voice; holding down fire/trigger for sustain/pause

It's still a little spotty. No graphics, outside of just sending syncs.

# Results/Notes
* Holding down left and right can make some iconic sound effects
* Holding up and down can be, but rarely seems to be, interesting
* There will be limits in sound, but just need cue, beat, and feedback sounds
